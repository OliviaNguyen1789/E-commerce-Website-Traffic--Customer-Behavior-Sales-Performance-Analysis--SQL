## üìå Background & Overview

### üìñ What is this project about?
The objective of this project is to analyze website traffic on an e-commerce platform to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and sales performance. This involves conducting a comprehensive traffic analysis and multi-channel evaluation, leveraging SQL techniques on Google BigQuery - Subquery, CTEs, and date-time manipulatio - to extract meaningful insights. The findings will be used to provide data-driven recommendations aimed at optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing overall business performance.

```sql
SELECT 
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month
      ,SUM(totals.visits) AS visits
      ,SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews
      ,SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions
      ,ROUND(SUM(totals.totalTransactionRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
  WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1;

üöÄ The results indicate that website traffic witnessed a significant rise in March (933), suggesting either enhanced conversion rates or seasonal influences.

### Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017
> A bounce rate indicates that customers who visited the website left without making a purchase.

```sql
SELECT
    trafficSource.source AS source,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits,
    SUM(totals.Bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces,
    ROUND(SUM(totals.Bounces)/SUM(totals.visits)* 100.00,2) AS bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

        ,UNNEST (hits) AS hits
        ,UNNEST (hits.product) AS product
  WHERE product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL 
      AND product.v2ProductName <> "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley"
      AND fullVisitorId IN (
            SELECT 
                DISTINCT fullVisitorId
            FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`

> To analyze the efficiency of the buying process and customers' behavior from product view to add-to-cart to purchase within a specific time period 

```sql
WITH product_data AS(
SELECT
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '2' THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_product_view,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '3' THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_add_to_cart,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '6' AND product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_purchase
