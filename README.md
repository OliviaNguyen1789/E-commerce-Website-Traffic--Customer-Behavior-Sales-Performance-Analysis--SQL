## I. Introduction

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset using advanced SQL techniques on Google BigQuery, including sliding windows, CTEs, and date-time manipulation.
The objectives are:
- Improving the company's revenue.
- Understanding customer behavior.
This analysis will help the Marketing and Sales teams make strategic, data-driven decisions to enhance business outcomes.

## II. Dataset Description

- Source: The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset.

-  Data Structure:
  
|----------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fullVisitorId                    | STRING    | The unique visitor ID.|
| date                             | STRING    | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format.|
| totals                           | RECORD    | This section contains aggregate values across the session.|
| totals.bounces                   | INTEGER   | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null.|
| totals.hits                      | INTEGER   | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.pageviews                 | INTEGER   | Total number of pageviews within the session.|
| totals.visits                    | INTEGER   | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session.|
| totals.transactions              | INTEGER   | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session.|
| trafficSource.source             | STRING    | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter.|
| hits                             | RECORD    | This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits.|
| hits.eCommerceAction             | RECORD    | This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected. |
| hits.eCommerceAction.action_type | STRING    | The action type. Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. 
Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a "product in list view"). 
Example query to calculate number of products in list views: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName) FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.product.isImpression == TRUE Example query to calculate number of products in detailed view: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName), FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.ecommerceaction.action_type = '2' AND ( BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) IS NULL OR BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) == FALSE ) |
| hits.product                     | RECORD    | This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data.|
| hits.product.productQuantity     | INTEGER   | The quantity of the product purchased.|
| hits.product.productRevenue      | INTEGER   | The revenue of the product, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000).|
| hits.product.productSKU          | STRING    | Product SKU. |
| hits.product.v2ProductName       | STRING    | Product Name.|
