| totals.visits                    | INTEGER   | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session.|

Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a "product in list view"). Example query to calculate number of products in list views: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName) FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.product.isImpression == TRUE Example query to calculate number of products in detailed view: SELECT COUNT(hits.product.v2ProductName), FROM [foo-160803:123456789.ga_sessions_20170101] WHERE hits.ecommerceaction.action_type = '2' AND ( BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) IS NULL OR BOOLEAN(hits.product.isImpression) == FALSE ) |
